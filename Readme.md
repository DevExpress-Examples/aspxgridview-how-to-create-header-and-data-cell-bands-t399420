# ASPxGridView - How to create header and data cell bands


<p>This example illustrates how to organize <strong>ASPxGridView</strong> columns and data cells into logical groups (bands) and display them using multi-row representation. Bands can be created by columns of the <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebGridViewBandColumntopic">GridViewBandColumn</a> type (header bands) or by using data columns bound to the grid (data cell bands). </p>
<p><strong>Header bands</strong> are used to organize columns into logical groups. They do not have associated data cells and are displayed only as a top-level header of the grid. <strong>Data cell bands</strong> are organized by using grid columns bound to data source fields. They contain data values displayed in the grid. <strong>Data cell bands</strong> allow you to create a structure according to which associated data cells will be displayed within grid rows.</p>
